# tinyTOC 0.8.1

Wordpress plugin from Arūnas Liuiza modified by Hani Ibrahim

**tinyTOC automaticly builds a table of contents using headings (h1-h6) in post/page/CPT content of a Wordpress blog**

## The original Code

[tinyTOC 0.8.0](http://wordpress.org/plugins/tinytoc) from Arūnas Liuiza works very well even with qTranslate-X. Unfortuantely the second hierarchie of the toc appears not as an unordered list but as an ordered list, see below

- Heading
  1. Heading
  2. Heading
- Heading

That does not fit very well.

## My Changes

tinyTOC 0.8.1 changed the ordered list of the second hierarchie to an unordered one and changed the symbol to the circle instead of a disc.
